## Background

In October of 2020 I was leaving a job and wanted to leave behind a landmark to all the shenanigans I got up to with soundboard software on my computer on joint calls. I'd also been itching to start writing some code again so I used this as a chance to brush up on Vue.js and general know-how. There's plenty of improvements that can be made here (easier configurability, namely) but for now I'm just working on getting ot to being a drop-in solution.
